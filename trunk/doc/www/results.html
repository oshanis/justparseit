		    <p>We have fully implemented the Policy Parser and 
              deployed it on the web. The following is a list of
              example sentences from which our system is able to 
              successfully generate RDFs:
            </p><br />
            <p>
              <ul id="panel">
                <li> Police may search people's homes if police have people's permission
                <li> MIT may use prox card data for criminal investigation
                <li> MIT students can not transfer prox cards to another student
                <li> A person may access data on the private mit domain if the person has permission for that data
                <li> A service provider may not use phone records to deny service to a customer
                <li> TSA can transfer data to the FBI if the data is associated with terrorism
                <li> Anyone can access data in the possession of the
                state of massachusetts
              </ul>
            </p><br />
            <p>
              This represents only a small subset of all sentences
              that our system is able to handle. For example, since
              our underlying CFG uses spelling change automata, it can
              successfully parse all sentences with variations that
              are recognized by these automata - for example, adding
              "s" to pluralize a noun or recognizing that 1st-person
              and 3rd-person verbs with the same root. In addition,
              by using the features in the CFG, the system is able to
              interpret whether two different sentences have the same
              meaning.  For example, the following two sentences
              result in the generation of the same RDF:
            </p><br />
            <p>
              <ul id="panel">
                <li> MIT can give records to FBI to investigate crimes.
                <li> MIT can give FBI records for criminal investigations.
                 </ul>
            </p><br />
            <p>
              The capacity of the Parser 
              depends on three parameters.  The first is 
              the FCFG (available <a href="data/grammar.fcfg">here</a>), 
              which determines the structure of
              sentences that the Parser is able to parse. As discussed in
              the <a href="implementation.html">Implementation</a>
              page, the current FCFG 
              recognizes the sentences of the form
            </p><br />
            <p>
            <tt>subject [mod] action object ['to' secondary_object] 
              ['for' purpose] [condition]*</tt>
            </p><br />
            <p>
            The second parameter is
            the <a href="data/sample.lex">lexicon</a> 
            and the <a href="data/gazdar.kimmo.yaml">spelling
            change rules</a>, both of which are used by the FCFG as 
            terminals. Technically, the number of sentences that are
            recognized by the FCFG is infinite, since the grammar is
            recursive (for example, it can parse sentences with an
            arbitrary number of repetitive propositional phrases such
            as "Committee on Discipline on Discipline on
            Discipline..."). However, only a finite subset of this
            infinite set contains meaningful sentences, so the
            capacity of our system cannot be judged purely by the
            number of sentences that it parses.
             </p><br />
            <p>
            The third parameter that determines the capacity of the
            Policy Parser is the set of domain ontologies (combined
            into a  <a href="data/ontology.n3">single file</a>), 
            which act as vocabularies during RDF
            generation. Therefore, even if the system is able to parse (NLTK
            parser) and interpret (Policy Interpreter) an input
            policy, it cannot
            generate a corresponding RDF if the constituents of the
            policy cannot be mapped to corresponding components of an
            ontology. 
            </p><br />
            <p>
              All these three parameters together define the
              limitation of our system, but this also means that each
              of them can be extended in order to make the system more
              flexible. For example, the FCFG can be modified to
              handle a wider variety of sentence structures; the
              lexicon can be expanded; and new ontologies can be added
              generate more RDFs.  These possible future extensions
              are discussed more thoroughly in the
              <a href="future.html">Future Directions</a> section.
            </p><br />
            <p>
            Another limitation of our system is that it cannot relate
            pronouns to its corresponding noun phrase. For example,
            the sentence 
            </p><br />
            <p>
              <b>A student can access data on the private MIT domain if
              she has the permission for that data</b>
            </p><br />
            <p>
            is rejected by the Policy Parser; to correct this, the
            user must replace <b>"she"</b> in the <b>"if"</b> 
            condition phrase with
            <b>"the student"</b>. In this particular case, it would have been
            possible to infer that the pronoun "she" actually refers
            to "the student", but in some other cases, such inferences
            can run into ambiguities that must be resolved - this is
            out of the scope of this project, but is considered 
            a possible future extension.

In this project we close the gap between authoring and execution of policies used by the "Accountability In RDF" (AIR) reasoning engine. At the moment, there is a human intermediary to do the translation from the actual policies to the RDF. Since these policies can follow a common syntactic structure, we hope that full machine text translation is attainable. In essence, a user such asÊ a lawyer should be able to write rules in constrained natural language, transform that into RDF and visualize the result.

An example rule is as follows:

"MIT Proximity Card Data Policy: Committee on Discipline (CoD)Ê can use proximity card data from the card reader logs for the purpose of criminal investigations only."

The parsed input should be able to identify the following components in the sentence to compose the rule in RDF:
POLICY => MIT Proximity Card Data Policy
ENTITY => Committee on Discipline (CoD)
DATA => proximity card data from the card reader logsÊ Ê
PURPOSE => criminal investigation
CONDITION => (not specified) 

We hope to use NLTK for the language parsing and develop our own software to convert the identified components into a machine parseable RDF.

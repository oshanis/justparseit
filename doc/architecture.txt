There are 2 levels of policy authoring as shown in the workflow above.

1. Top level abstract policy definition, which defines the structure of the policy
Example template:
POLICY: ENTITY [can|cannot] [use|transfer|access] DATA for the PURPOSE only when CONDITION 

2. Actual policy which follows one of those formats already defined
Example:
Committee on Discipline (CoD)Ê can use proximity card data from the card reader logs for the purpose of criminal investigations only.

		    <h2> What is the Policy Parser?</h2>
			<br />
			<p> Lawyers work with law-enforcement policies.  
              Given a scenario and a set of policies, one of 
              their main tasks is to determine whether a particular 
              sequence of events in this scenario
			  violates one or more give policies. 
              This can prove to be a challenging and error-prone process, 
              as the number of policies gets larger
              or the scenario itself becomes more complex.  Fortunately,
              some parts of
              this task involve purely deductive reasoning, and therefore,
              can be automated by a computer. Thanks to 
              recent advancements in knowledge-based reasoning, 
              there now exist systems that can assist lawyers in 
              this process; 
              the <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/TAMI/2007/AIR/">
                AIR ("Accountability in RDF") Reasoner</a> 
              is one of such systems. 
            </p><br />
            <p>  One of the current barriers to a wide spread of
              AIR is that it requires the user of the system to be
              knowledgeable about a specialized computer language.
              The input language to AIR is in
              Resource Description Framework (RDF), a data model
              proposed by the WWW consortium as a major mechanism of
              information exchange throughout the web. Although RDF is
              a well-known, portable language, many laywers are still not
              familiar with it. When faced with the task of
              learning RDF, many of them are likely to turn away and seek
              for a tool that is easier to use. Even for someone who
              is an expert in RDF, translating a natural language
              policy into RDF can be tedious and time-consuming. 
            </p><br />
            <p>  In order to solve these challenges, we have built the
              <b>Policy Parser</b>, which takes a policy, written in natural
              language, and automatically translates it into an RDF
              format. A high-level architecture of our system is shown
              in the following: 
            </p><br />
            <p> Our user enters a policy sentence into our
            system using a web interface (available 
              <a href="try.html">here</a>). The sentence is then
              parsed into a feature-based context-free grammar (FCFG) using
              the NLTK system [1]. In the next step,  
              the Policy Interpreter extracts semantic information about the
              policy (e.g. the actor who is responsible for a
              particular action) from the CFG. This information is
              passed to the RDF Generator, which then generates an RDF
              file that corresponds to this policy and stores it in 
              a persistent location (URI) on the web. 
              The user can immediately (or at any
              later convenient time) check the compliance/violation of 
              the policy by providing the URI and a particular scenario to the
              AIR reasoner, which is executible directly from the web. 
            </p><br />

		<div><b>Support the end-term goal of a fully automated policy compliance system: </b>The main goal of the Policy Parser is to allow a simple tool for
		people who are not
		proficient enough in authoring AIR policies in RDF. While we have achieved this goal successfully, more work remains in the area of generating log files
		automatically and reason over them with the policies which have been generated by the system to check for policy compliance.<div>

		<br/>
		
		<div><b>Support for more policy sentence templates: </b>The current implementation handles only a handful of sentence formats which includes the components 
		"ENTITY", "ACTOR", "ACTION", "DATA", "PURPOSE", "PASSIVE ENTITY" and "CONDITION"s. However many policies will have different 
		sentence templates which needs to be addressed in the Policy Parser. Ideally there should be an interface where a policy administrator should be 
		able to look at the available policies and modify them or add new policy templates to the system.</div>
		
		<br/>
		<div><b>Handle other types of "passive entities": </b>The Policy Parser is only capable of handling passive entities which are associated with the 
		main verb, i.e. the "ACTION". However, in a sentence such as "A service provider may not use phone records to deny service to a customer", the entity
		"customer" is actually associated with the "PURPOSE". Therefore </div>		
		
		<br/>
		
		<div><b>Extending the lexicon: </b>Currently the interface to the user only allows to select a particular domain ontology. 
		However, the user should have the freedom to
		define an ontology and add new terms into an existing ontology. Also this requires extending the lexicon used in parsing the sentence</div>

		<br/>
		
		<div><b>Give more meaningful error messages: </b> The user might be interested in knowing the exact point of failure when a sentence could not be 
		parsed correctly to an AIR policy written in RDF. For example the failure could be due to the fact a <b>particular</b> word used in the sentence is
		not in the lexicon, or the sentence is written in an unknown template, or the "features" extracted by the PolicyInterpreter is not found in the 
		domain ontology or any combination of these. Currently there is no robust mechanism of letting the user of the point of failure. However including
		such a feature would be beneficial. 
		</div>
		
		<br/>
		
		<div><b>Show the user policies in the current "Online Policy Store": </b>Users may be curious as to see what policies have already been generated 
		from the system. Thus, showing them the contents of the current "Online Policy Store" which could be a single centralized location or strewn acorss
		few locations would be useful.
